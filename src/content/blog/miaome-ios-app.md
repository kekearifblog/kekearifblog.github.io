An old app "miaoME" from the archives. The very first iOS app I ever designed and published back in 2015.

This app was created with the idea of sending friends predefined messages using stickers referred to as "Miaos". The more messages sent, the more stickers the user could unlock, each featuring a unique cat character with its own intriguing story.

Coded in Objective-C and featuring a Parse(!) backend. Old school.
